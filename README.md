I have attached my latest two pieces of art, The Divine Joys of Poking a Bear, a 21 page open letter to Kenneth C. Griffin. In this letter, I provide context to the atrocities he has been committing on the art world, the stock markets, and society at large, and demand he cease and desist. The letter has also been converted to an audio file, for easier access, which lasts 40 minutes long. Within the letter, I also explain the motives behind the 2nd ARG that I have created, and is playing out right now. 

In relation to this art piece is also the announcement of the future minting of an NFT, titled The Logistical, which I estimated to be over $100 Trillion. Yes, $100 Trillion.  This is not a joke, and I would be extremely grateful to any person who takes the time to read, or listen, to the words that I have written. If you agree with the sentiment and claims that I have made, I would also greatly appreciate any person who decides to take actions on spreading the word of this project. In return, you have my word, as an artist with integrity, that I will make no money off of it. 

All profits from this NFT will go to non-profits fighting world hunger and homelessness.
